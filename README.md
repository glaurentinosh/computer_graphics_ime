## Projective Mapping
  
  In this project, we are going to map a texture on a quadrilateral region in a background image, using projective transformations.
  
  Inside the folder _projectiveMapping_, we have a python script _main.py_, where we left hard-coded the background and texture images, also the coordinates of the vertices of the quadrilateral.
  
  You can also call the script as shown below:
  
  ```BASH
  python main.py texture.jpg background.jpg ax ay bx by cx cy dx dy
  ```
  
  Here, (ax, ay), (bx, by), (cx, cy), (dx, dy) are the vertices of the quadrilateral.
